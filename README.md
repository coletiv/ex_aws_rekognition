# ExAws.Rekognition

Rekognition uses [ex_aws](https://github.com/ex-aws/ex_aws) under the hood so you should go through their [README](https://github.com/ex-aws/ex_aws/blob/master/README.md) for more information on how to setup/configure the project, it's really easy.

You can check [AWS Rekognition documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/API_Operations.html) for the list of functionalities and available actions.
